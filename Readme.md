# ParseJSON

This is a little routine I put together to parse JSON in SQL Server in the old days before we had full support. It has proved to be surprisingly popular.

To my shame, I fear that I haven't been maintaining ParseJSON as I should. I thought this routine would be a temporary fix for people who were on old versions of SQL Server, but I'm surprised to see that the article I wrote has now had a third of a million views.

Here is the latest version of the code. Hopefully it is up-to-date.I've updated it to run in a binary collation.

If you have any fixes, please let mye know and I'll add them in.
